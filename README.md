# Svelte version of WORDLE

## A recreation of the game "wordle" made with Svelte and Tailwind for CSS

<div style="display:flex;justify-content: center;">
  <img src="./src/assets/logo.png" />
</div>
In project I used npm package called "word-list-json" containing most of the english words. In game you can set number of letters in the word you are guessing.

## Run Locally:

Clone the repository and perform the following command line actions:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Next open http://localhost:3000 in browser

## Building

To create a production version of app:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
